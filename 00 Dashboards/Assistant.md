Use a configured agent inside the vault through Agent Client. The workflows ask the agent to follow `AGENTS.md`; that is a policy, not a technical guarantee that every client will request approval. Check that automatic approvals are off in the client you use. Setup: [[14 Agent Client and Claude Code]]. Without the plugin, read a note in `Prompts/` and copy its Prompt section into your chosen agent ([[20 Prompt Library]]).

## Before you send

The buttons below prepare a prompt with automatic sending disabled. Review it in the composer before sending. This embedded chat is configured to use the hosting Assistant note as context, not to guarantee inclusion of whichever other note you last viewed.

- Check the selected agent, mentioned notes, attachments, and linked-note expansion settings.
- A provider-backed conversation can send your prompt and included or subsequently retrieved notes to that provider. Journal and relationship notes can contain sensitive personal information.
- For a broad review, first ask for the proposed note paths and date range. Approve the context you want read before continuing.
- Approving a context selection is not approval to edit, install, spend, or publish.
- A configured agent or local API key is not proof of authentication, a working connection, or a successfully tested workflow.

The first-party Life OS dashboard does not make provider calls. These controls hand off to Agent Client; its settings, external clients, and the chosen agent determine actual behavior.
