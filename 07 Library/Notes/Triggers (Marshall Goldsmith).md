## Summary in three sentences
Our environment triggers behaviour more than our intentions do. Active questions ("Did I do my best to...") shift responsibility to effort, which we control, instead of outcomes, which we do not. Scoring them daily on a 1 to 10 scale, and having to face the scores, is the trigger that produces change.

## Key ideas
- Passive questions ("Do you have clear goals?") invite blame on the environment. Active questions ("Did I do my best to set clear goals?") put the effort on you.
- Score effort, not results. You cannot control results anyway.
- Consistency beats intensity: the questions work because they are answered every day.

## Quotes
> "Did I do my best to..." is the frame: you grade the intention, not the outcome. ^daily-questions

## How this changes what I do
- One `dq_*` property per question in every daily note (six shipped, editable in Compass Config), answered at 21:00 through the Daily Questions Prompt.
